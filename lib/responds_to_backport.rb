  # Responder is responsible to expose a resource for different mime requests,
  # usually depending on the HTTP verb. The responder is triggered when
  # respond_with is called. The simplest case to study is a GET request:
  #
  #   class PeopleController < ApplicationController
  #     respond_to :html, :xml, :json
  #
  #     def index
  #       @people = Person.find(:all)
  #       respond_with(@people)
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # When a request comes, for example with format :xml, three steps happen:
  #
  #   1) responder searches for a template at people/index.xml;
  #
  #   2) if the template is not available, it will invoke :to_xml in the given resource;
  #
  #   3) if the responder does not respond_to :to_xml, call :to_format on it.
  #
  # === Builtin HTTP verb semantics
  #
  # Rails default responder holds semantics for each HTTP verb. Depending on the
  # content type, verb and the resource status, it will behave differently.
  #
  # Using Rails default responder, a POST request for creating an object could
  # be written as:
  #
  #   def create
  #     @user = User.new(params[:user])
  #     flash[:notice] = 'User was successfully created.' if @user.save
  #     respond_with(@user)
  #   end
  #
  # Which is exactly the same as:
  #
  #   def create
  #     @user = User.new(params[:user])
  #
  #     respond_to do |format|
  #       if @user.save
  #         flash[:notice] = 'User was successfully created.'
  #         format.html { redirect_to(@user) }
  #         format.xml { render :xml => @user, :status => :created, :location => @user }
  #       else
  #         format.html { render :action => "new" }
  #         format.xml { render :xml => @user.errors, :status => :unprocessable_entity }
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # The same happens for PUT and DELETE requests.
  #
  # === Nested resources
  #
  # You can given nested resource as you do in form_for and polymorphic_url.
  # Consider the project has many tasks example. The create action for
  # TasksController would be like:
  #
  #   def create
  #     @project = Project.find(params[:project_id])
  #     @task = @project.comments.build(params[:task])
  #     flash[:notice] = 'Task was successfully created.' if @task.save
  #     respond_with(@project, @task)
  #   end
  #
  # Giving an array of resources, you ensure that the responder will redirect to
  # project_task_url instead of task_url.
  #
  # Namespaced and singleton resources requires a symbol to be given, as in
  # polymorphic urls. If a project has one manager which has many tasks, it
  # should be invoked as:
  #
  #   respond_with(@project, :manager, @task)
  #
  # Check polymorphic_url documentation for more examples.

    # Without web-service support, an action which collects the data for displaying a list of people
    # might look something like this:
    #
    #   def index
    #     @people = Person.find(:all)
    #   end
    #
    # Here's the same action, with web-service support baked in:
    #
    #   def index
    #     @people = Person.find(:all)
    #
    #     respond_to do |format|
    #       format.html
    #       format.xml { render :xml => @people.to_xml }
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # What that says is, "if the client wants HTML in response to this action, just respond as we
    # would have before, but if the client wants XML, return them the list of people in XML format."
    # (Rails determines the desired response format from the HTTP Accept header submitted by the client.)
    #
    # Supposing you have an action that adds a new person, optionally creating their company
    # (by name) if it does not already exist, without web-services, it might look like this:
    #
    #   def create
    #     @company = Company.find_or_create_by_name(params[:company][:name])
    #     @person  = @company.people.create(params[:person])
    #
    #     redirect_to(person_list_url)
    #   end
    #
    # Here's the same action, with web-service support baked in:
    #
    #   def create
    #     company  = params[:person].delete(:company)
    #     @company = Company.find_or_create_by_name(company[:name])
    #     @person  = @company.people.create(params[:person])
    #
    #     respond_to do |format|
    #       format.html { redirect_to(person_list_url) }
    #       format.js
    #       format.xml  { render :xml => @person.to_xml(:include => @company) }
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # If the client wants HTML, we just redirect them back to the person list. If they want Javascript
    # (format.js), then it is an RJS request and we render the RJS template associated with this action.
    # Lastly, if the client wants XML, we render the created person as XML, but with a twist: we also
    # include the person's company in the rendered XML, so you get something like this:
    #
    #   <person>
    #     <id>...</id>
    #     ...
    #     <company>
    #       <id>...</id>
    #       <name>...</name>
    #       ...
    #     </company>
    #   </person>
    #
    # Note, however, the extra bit at the top of that action:
    #
    #   company  = params[:person].delete(:company)
    #   @company = Company.find_or_create_by_name(company[:name])
    #
    # This is because the incoming XML document (if a web-service request is in process) can only contain a
    # single root-node. So, we have to rearrange things so that the request looks like this (url-encoded):
    #
    #   person[name]=...&person[company][name]=...&...
    #
    # And, like this (xml-encoded):
    #
    #   <person>
    #     <name>...</name>
    #     <company>
    #       <name>...</name>
    #     </company>
    #   </person>
    #
    # In other words, we make the request so that it operates on a single entity's person. Then, in the action,
    # we extract the company data from the request, find or create the company, and then create the new person
    # with the remaining data.
    #
    # Note that you can define your own XML parameter parser which would allow you to describe multiple entities
    # in a single request (i.e., by wrapping them all in a single root node), but if you just go with the flow
    # and accept Rails' defaults, life will be much easier.
    #
    # If you need to use a MIME type which isn't supported by default, you can register your own handlers in
    # environment.rb as follows.
    #
    #   Mime::Type.register "image/jpg", :jpg
    #
    # Respond to also allows you to specify a common block for different formats by using any:
    #
    #   def index
    #     @people = Person.find(:all)
    #
    #     respond_to do |format|
    #       format.html
    #       format.any(:xml, :json) { render request.format.to_sym => @people }
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # In the example above, if the format is xml, it will render:
    #
    #   render :xml => @people
    #
    # Or if the format is json:
    #
    #   render :json => @people
    #
    # Since this is a common pattern, you can use the class method respond_to
    # with the respond_with method to have the same results:
    #
    #   class PeopleController < ApplicationController
    #     respond_to :html, :xml, :json
    #
    #     def index
    #       @people = Person.find(:all)
    #       respond_with(@person)
    #     end
    #   end
